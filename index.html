  <h3>As an aspiring journalist, Jacke Lamb knows that she should have more direction in what she wants to do and where she wants to go. She can't make up her mind. If you give her a camera, she can take pictures to capture moments on film. Give her some research and a glorious written piece will be delivered. With some audio pieces, a podcast or a newstory can be created. A topic and color scheme? Graphic designs can come your way. <br> <br> Jackie's brain is teeming with creativity with confusion on which outlet works best for her. Her experience at the Univeristy of Missouri-Columbia is only expanding her skills. She is slowly reaching decisions on where she might want to end up. Graphic designs and an online presence are beginning to topple the other ideas. Magazine envolvement is coming up closely behind. It will be race to see who can make her fall more in love. <br> <br> Jackie Lamb is open to work part-time, contract or freelance. </h3>
